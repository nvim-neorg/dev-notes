* Basic Idea
  Enable the possibility of specifying tag parameters which consist of multiple words.

** Why?
   Currently, parameters are specified for example like so:

   = ToC Table of Contents

   While in this example, it makes sense that all three words are considered to be part of a single parameter (the /title/), this is not evident.
   Furthermore, other scenarios can be envisioned where more than one parameter are required and ambiguity will arise which words belong to which parameter.

   To alleviate that, we can introduce a _separator_ which can be manually inserted in order to disambiguate the parameter distinction.

** How?
   Looking at tables, the pipe character, `|`, seems like a good fit here, too:
   #choice multiple | Make any number of choices:
   (Example taken from {:../multiple-choice-questions/initial-ideas:})

** Requirements
   - Treesiter
   -- special handling of `|` in tag/insertion parameters

   - Neorg
   -- nothing? ðŸ¤”
